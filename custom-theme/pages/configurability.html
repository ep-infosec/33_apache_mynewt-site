        <h2>Newt Tool makes it easy to Compose and Configure</h2>

        <p>
        Mynewt  exposes a highly granular set of configuration parameters for each software module or service. For example, the BLE controller stack allows the user to set parameters such as the whitelist size, sleep clock accuracy, number of slots to allocate to each connection, transmit power level, and plenty more. To keep configuration clean and simple, settings are specified in a single syscfg.yml configuration file in each package. Sensible defaults are built into all the configuration files to allow a quick build for simple, straightforward applications.
        </p>

        <p>
    Hardware initialization sets up the flash map and peripherals such as UART, ADC, SPI, I2C etc. on the chosen board. For consistency, this hardware-specific initialization is also done using a single syscfg.yml configuration file for the BSP (Board Support Package). Again, sensible defaults are built into all the configuration files for common use cases.

        <p>
    Mynewt comes with a powerful configuration and build tool called Newt. It can automatically generate a single, comprehensive system configuration file from the various software and hardware initialization files. This makes system configuration audits easy. Newt Tool can manage task and interrupt priority settings. It can also detect and resolve conflicts in package dependencies. It comes with utilities such as generating digitally signed images. In short, putting an image together for your application becomes easy with the Newt Tool.
