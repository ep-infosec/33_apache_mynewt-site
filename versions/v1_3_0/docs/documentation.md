## Documentation Source

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Apache Mynewt documentation is undergoing a reorganization as of Jan/21/2017. Please check with project committers
for the best location to make changes in order to avoid duplication of effort.
</div>

* The stable and earlier documentation is still maintained in the apache/mynewt-site repo.
    * [https://github.com/apache/mynewt-site](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-site)
    * This will eventually be used only for site pages. i.e. content relating to the project that is not dependent on
      a software release like the home page, community, events and quick start.
    * It will also contain earlier versions of the full documentation set until such time as they become obsolete.
* The most recent project documentation can be found in the apache/mynewt-documentation repo.
    * [https://github.com/apache/mynewt-documentation](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-documentation)
    * This holds content like tutorials, FAQs, etc. i.e. content that may change as software changes and can therefore
      be pinned to a particular release version.
* Specific code documentation is found in each of the apache/mynewt-* code repos under /docs.
    * e.g. [https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/docs](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/docs)
