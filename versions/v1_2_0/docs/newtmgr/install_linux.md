## Installing Newtmgr on Linux

You can install the latest release (1.2.0) of the newtmgr tool from a Debian binary package (amd64). You can also download and build the latest release version of newtmgr from source.   

This page shows you how to: 

1. Set up your computer to download Debian binary packages from the runtimeco APT repository.

    **Note:** The key for signing the repository has changed. If you set up your computer before release 1.1.0, you will need to download and import the public key again. 

2. Install the latest release version of newtmgr from a Debian binary package. You can use apt-get to install the package or manually download and install the Debian binary package.

3. Download, build, and install the latest release version of newtmgr from source. 

See [Installing Previous Releases of Newtgmr](/newtmgr/prev_releases) to install an earlier version of newtmgr.

If you are installing on an amd64 platform, we recommend that you install from the binary package.

**Note:**  We have tested the newtmgr tool binary and apt-get install from the runtimeco APT repository for Ubuntu version 16.  Earlier Ubuntu versions (for example: Ubuntu 14) may have incompatibility with the repository. You can manually download and install the Debian binary package.


**Note:** See [Setting Up a Go Environment to Contribute to Newt and Newtmgr Tools](/faq/go_env) if you want to:  

* Use the newtmgr tool with the latest updates from the master branch. The master branch may be unstable and we recommend that you use the latest stable release version.
* Contribute to the newtmgr tool.

### Setting Up Your Computer to use apt-get to Install the Package

The newtmgr Debian packages are stored in a private APT repository on **https://github/runtimeco/debian-mynewt**.   To use apt-get, you must set up the following on your computer to retrieve packages from the repository:

**Note**: You only need to perform this setup once on your computer. However, if you previously downloaded and imported the public key for the runtimeco APT repository, you will need to perform step 2 again as the key has changed.


1. Install the `apt-transport-https` package to use HTTPS to retrieve packages. 
2. Download the public key for the runtimeco APT repository and import the key into the apt keychain.
3. Add the repository for the binary and source packages to the apt source list.

<br>
1. Install the apt-transport-https package:

```no-highlight
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

<br>
2. Download the public key for the runtimeco apt repo  (**Note:** There is  a `-` after  `apt-key add`):

```no-highlight
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master/mynewt.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

<br>
3. Add the repository for the binary packages to the `mynewt.list` apt source list file.

```no-highlight
$sudo -s
[sudo] password for <user>:
root$ cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mynewt.list <<EOF
deb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master latest main
EOF
root$exit
```
**Note:** Do not forget to exit the root shell.

<br>
4. Verify the content of the source list file:

```no-highlight
$more /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mynewt.list
deb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master latest main
```

<br>
5. Update the available packages:

```no-highlight
$sudo apt-get update
```

<br>
**Note:** If you are not using Ubuntu version 16, you may see the following errors.  We have provided instructions on how to manually download and install the binary package.

```no-highlight

W: Failed to fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master/dists/latest/main/source/Sources  HttpError404

```

### Installing the Latest Release of Newtmgr from a Binary Package 

You can use either apt-get to install the package, or manually download and install the Debian binary package. 

<br>
#### Method 1: Using apt-get to Upgrade or to Install

Run the following commands to upgrade or install the latest version of newtmgr:

```no-highlight

$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install newtmgr

```

#### Method 2: Downloading and Installing the Debian Package Manually

Download and install the package manually.

```no-highlight
$wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/binary-releases/master/mynewt-newt-tools_1.2.0/newtmgr_1.2.0-1_amd64.deb
$sudo dpkg -i newtmgr_1.2.0-1_amd64.deb
```

See [Checking the Installed Version of Newtmgr](#check) to verify that you are using the installed version of newtmgr.

<br>
### Installing the Latest Release Version of Newtmgr from Source

If you are running Linux on a different architecture, you can build and install the latest release version of newtmgr from source.

<br>
1. Download and install the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/dl/). Newtmgr requires Go version 1.7.6 or higher.

<br>
2. Create a Go workspace in the /tmp directory: 

```no-highlight

$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir go
$ cd go
$ export GOPATH=/tmp/go

```

<br>
3. Run `go get` to download the newtmgr source.  Note that `go get` pulls down the HEAD from the master branch in git, builds, and installs newtmgr.

```no-highlight

$ go get mynewt.apache.org/newtmgr/newtmgr
$ ls -l /tmp/go/bin/newtmgr
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user staff  17884488 Jul 29 16:25 /tmp/go/bin/newtmgr

```

<br>
4. Check out the source from the latest release version:

```no-highlight

$ cd src/mynewt.apache.org/newtmgr
$ git checkout mynewt_1_2_0_tag
Note: checking out 'mynewt_1_2_0_tag'.

```

<br> 5. Build newtmgr from the latest release version: 

```no-highlight

$ cd newtmgr
$ go install
$ ls /tmp/go/bin/newtmgr
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff  17888680 Jul 29 16:28 /tmp/go/bin/newtmgr

```

<br>
6. If you have a Go workspace, remember to reset your GOPATH to your Go workspace.

<br>
7. Copy the newtmgr executable to a bin directory in your path. You can put it in the /usr/bin or the $GOPATH/bin directory.

<br>
