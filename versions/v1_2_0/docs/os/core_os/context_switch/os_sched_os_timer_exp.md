```c
void os_sched_os_timer_exp(void)
```

Inform scheduler that OS time has moved forward, and it should inspect tasks which are *sleeping* to check whether they should be moved to *g_run_list* or not.

This function should be called from code which handles moving OS time forward. After calling it, the highest priority task which is *ready to run* might've changed, so call to *os_sched()* should be done.
