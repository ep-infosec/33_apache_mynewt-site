### Checking the Installed Version

Check that you are using the installed version of newt:

```no-highlight

$which newt
/usr/local/bin/newt
$ls -l /usr/local/bin/newt
lrwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff  36 Jul 25 19:04 /usr/local/bin/newt -> ../Cellar/mynewt-newt/1.1.0/bin/newt
$newt version
Apache Newt version: 1.1.0

```
**Note:** If you previously built newt from source and the output of `which newt` shows "$GOPATH/bin/newt", you will need to move "$GOPATH/bin"  after "/usr/local/bin" for your PATH in  ~/.bash_profile, and source ~/.bash_profile.

### Installing Earlier Release Versions of Newt

If you want to install newt 1.0, run the following commands:

```no-highlight

$ brew update
$ brew install mynewt-newt@1.0

```

**Note:** This is a keg-only installation.  newt 1.0 is installed in /usr/local/Cellar/mynewt-newt@1.0/1.0.0/bin but not symlinked into /usr/local/bin. 
 
If you need this version of newt first in your PATH, run the following commands:

```no-highlight

$ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/mynewt-newt@1.0/1.0.0/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile

```

<br>
You can also manually symlink into /usr/local/bin as follows:

1. Unlink newt if you have the latest version of newt installed:

        $ brew unlink mynewt-newt 

2. Link mynewt-newt@1.0 into /usr/local/bin:

        $ brew link -f mynewt-newt@1.0


<br>
