### Checking the Installed Version

Check that you are using the installed version of newtmgr:
```no-highlight
$which newtmgr
/usr/local/bin/newtmgr
ls -l /usr/local/bin/newtmgr
lrwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff  42 Jul 25 21:15 /usr/local/bin/newtmgr -> ../Cellar/mynewt-newtmgr/1.1.0/bin/newtmgr
```
**Note:** If you previously built newtmgr from source and the output of `which newtmgr` shows "$GOPATH/bin/newtmgr", you will need to move "$GOPATH/bin"  after "/usr/local/bin" for your PATH in  ~/.bash_profile, and source ~/.bash_profile.

### Installing Earlier Release Versions of Newtmgr

If you want to install newtmgr 1.0, run the following commands:

```no-highlight

$ brew update
$ brew install mynewt-newtmgr@1.0

```

**Note:** This is a keg-only installation.  newt 1.0 is installed in /usr/local/Cellar/mynewt-newtmgr@1.0/1.0.0/bin but not symlinked into /usr/local/bin.  

If you need this version of newt first in your PATH, run the following commands:

```no-highlight

$ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/mynewt-newtmgr@1.0/1.0.0/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile

```

<br>
You can also manually symlink into /usr/local/bin as follows:

1. Unlink newtmgr if you have the latest version of newt installed:
    
        $ brew unlink mynewt-newtmgr

2. Link mynewt-newt@1.0 into /usr/local/bin:

        $ brew link -f mynewt-newt@1.0

<br>
### Installing Newtmgr from the Master Branch 

We recommend that you use the latest release version (1.1.0) of newtmgr. If you would like to use the master branch with the latest updates, you can install newtmgr from the HEAD of the master branch. 

** Notes: **

* The master branch may be unstable.
* This installation will install the latest version of Go on your computer, if it is not installed, and compile newtmgr locally. 

<br>
If you already installed newtgmr, unlink the current version:
```no-highlight
$brew unlink mynewt-newtmgr
```
<br>
