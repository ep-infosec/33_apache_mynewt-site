# Documentation Organization

The technical literature for Apache Mynewt is organized into three manuals. The first describes the Real Time Operating System (RTOS), its features and capabilities, and how to get it running on your target device. The second one demonstrates how to use the build and packaging tool, *Newt*, to easily choose firmware modules for your target and compose them into a working executable. The third manual shows how the device management tool, *Newtmgr*, can communicate with a remote device running Mynewt OS and monitor, configure, and upgrade it.

For you to learn and get some hands-on experience, each manual includes one or more tutorials. We encourage that you try them, and do send us your feedback.
