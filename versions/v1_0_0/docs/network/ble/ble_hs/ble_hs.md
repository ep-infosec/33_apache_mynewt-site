# NimBLE Host

### Introduction

At a high level, the NimBLE stack is divided into two components:

* Host
* Controller

This document is an API reference for the host component.  If you are interested in the general structure of the NimBLE stack and its non-host components, you might want to read the [BLE introduction](../ble_intro.md).

The host sits directly below the application, and it serves as the interface to the application for all BLE operations.
