     * HCI buffers can get tied up when the controller sends lots of
     * asynchronous / unsolicited events (i.e., non-acks).  When the controller
     * needs to send one of these events, it allocates an HCI buffer, fills it
     * with the event payload, and puts it on a host queue.  If the controller
     * sends a quick burst of these events, the buffer pool may be exhausted,
     * preventing the host from sending an HCI command to the controller.
     *
     * Every time the controller sends a non-ack HCI event to the host, it also
     * allocates an OS event (it is unfortunate that these are both called
     * "events").  The OS event is put on the host-parent-task's event queue;
     * it is what wakes up the host-parent-task and indicates that an HCI event
     * needs to be processsed.  The pool of OS events is allocated with the
     * same number of elements as the HCI buffer pool.
