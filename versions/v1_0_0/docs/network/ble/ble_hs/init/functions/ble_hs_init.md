```c
int
ble_hs_init(
     struct os_eventq *app_evq,
    struct ble_hs_cfg *cfg
)
```

### Description

Initializes the NimBLE host.  This function must be called before the OS is started.  The NimBLE stack requires an application task to function.  One application task in particular is designated as the "host parent task".  In addition to application-specific work, the host parent task does work for NimBLE by processing events generated by the host.

### Parameters

| *Parameter* | *Description* |
|-------------|---------------|
| app\_evq | The event queue associated with the host parent task. |
| cfg | The set of configuration settings to initialize the host with.  Specify null for defaults. |

### Returned values

| *Value* | *Condition* |
|---------|-------------|
| 0 | Success. |
| [Core return code](../../ble_hs_return_codes/#return-codes-core) | Unexpected error. |
