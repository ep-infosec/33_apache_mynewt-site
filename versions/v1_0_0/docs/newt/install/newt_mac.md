```
You can also extract (or `git clone`) Homebrew and install it to /usr/local.

```
<br>
**Note:** This installs the newt 1.0.0 binary that has been tested on Mac OS 10.9 and higher. If you are running an earlier version of Mac OS, the installation will install the latest version of Go and compile newt locally.

<br>
Check that you are using the installed version of newt:
```no-highlight
$which newt
/usr/local/bin/newt
$ls -l /usr/local/bin/newt
lrwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff  36 Apr 15 08:18 /usr/local/bin/newt -> ../Cellar/mynewt-newt/1.0.0/bin/newt
$newt version
Apache Newt (incubating) version: 1.0.0
```
**Note:** If you previously built newt from source and the output of `which newt` shows "$GOPATH/bin/newt", you will need to move "$GOPATH/bin"  after "/usr/local/bin" in your $PATH.
