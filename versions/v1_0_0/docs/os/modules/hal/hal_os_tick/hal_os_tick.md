# hal_os_tick

The hardware independent interface to set up interrupt timers or halt CPU in terms of OS ticks.

###Description

Set up the periodic timer to interrupt at a frequency of 'os_ticks_per_sec' using the following function call where 'prio' is the cpu-specific priority of the periodic timer interrupt. 

```c
void os_tick_init(uint32_t os_ticks_per_sec, int prio);
```

You can halt CPU for up to `n` ticks:

```c
void os_tick_idle(os_time_t n);
```

The function implementations are in the mcu-specific directories such as `hw/mcu/nordic/nrf51xxx/src/hal_os_tick.c`.

###Examples

An example of the API being used by the OS kernel for the Cortex M0 architecture to initialize and start the system clock timer can be seen in [kernel/os/src/arch/cortex_m0/os_arch_arm.c](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core/blob/master/kernel/os/src/arch/cortex_m0/os_arch_arm.c).
