```c
os_error_t os_mutex_init(struct os_mutex *mu)
```

Initialize the mutex. Must be called before the mutex can be used.

#### Arguments

| Arguments | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `*mu`|  Pointer to mutex  |

#### Returned values

`OS_INVALID_PARM`: returned when `*mu` is **NULL** on entry.

`OS_OK`: mutex initialized successfully.

#### Notes 

<Any special feature/special benefit that we want to tout. 
Does it need to be used with some other specific functions?
Any caveats to be careful about (e.g. high memory requirements).>

#### Example


```c
struct os_mutex g_mutex1;
os_error_t err;

err = os_mutex_init(&g_mutex1);
assert(err == OS_OK);
```
