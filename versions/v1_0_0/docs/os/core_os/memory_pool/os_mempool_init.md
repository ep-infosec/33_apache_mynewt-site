```c
os_error_t os_mempool_init(struct os_mempool *mp, int blocks, int block_size, void *membuf, char *name)
```

Initializes the memory pool. Memory pointed to by `membuf` is divided into `blocks` number of elements of size `OS_ALIGN(*block_size*)`. The `name` is optional, and names the memory pool.

It is assumed that the amount of memory pointed by `membuf` has at least `OS_MEMPOOL_BYTES(blocks, block_size)` number of bytes.

`name` is not copied, so caller should make sure that the memory does not get reused.

#### Arguments

| Arguments | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `mp` |  Memory pool being initialized  |
| `blocks` |  Number of elements in the pool  |
| `block_size` | Minimum size of an individual element in pool |
| `membuf` | Backing store for the memory pool elements |
| `name` | Name of the memory pool |

#### Returned values

`OS_OK`: operation was successful.  
`OS_INVALID_PARAM`: invalid parameters. Block count or block size was negative, or `membuf` or `mp` was **NULL**.  
`OS_MEM_NOT_ALIGNED`: `membuf` was not aligned on correct byte boundary.

#### Notes 

Note that `os_mempool_init()` does not allocate backing storage; `membuf` has to be allocated by the caller.

It's recommended that you use `OS_MEMPOOL_BYTES()` or `OS_MEMPOOL_SIZE()` to figure out how much memory to allocate for the pool.

#### Example

<Add text to set up the context for the example here>

```c
    void *nffs_file_mem;
   
    nffs_file_mem = malloc(OS_MEMPOOL_BYTES(nffs_config.nc_num_files, sizeof (struct nffs_file)));
    										  
    rc = os_mempool_init(&nffs_file_pool, nffs_config.nc_num_files,
                         sizeof (struct nffs_file), nffs_file_mem,
                         "nffs_file_pool");
    if (rc != 0) {
        /* Memory pool initialization failure */
    }

```
