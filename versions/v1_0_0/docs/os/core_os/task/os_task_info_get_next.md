```c
struct os_task *os_task_info_get_next(const struct os_task *prev, struct os_task_info *oti);
```
Populates the os task info structure pointed to by `oti` with task information. 
The task populating the `oti` structure is either the first task on the task 
list if `prev` is **NULL**, or the next task in the task list (the next pointer of 
`prev`).
 
If there are no tasks initialized, **NULL** is returned. Otherwise, the task 
structure used to populate `oti` is returned.

#### Arguments

| Arguments | Description | 
|-----------|-------------| 
| `prev` | Pointer to previous task in task list. If NULL, use first task on list |
| `oti` |  Pointer to `os_task_info` structure where task information will be stored | 

<br>
#### Returned values

Returns a pointer to the os task structure that was used to populate the task 
information structure. **NULL** means that no tasks were created.

#### Example

```c

void 
get_task_info(void)
{
    struct os_task *prev_task; 
    struct os_task_info oti; 

    console_printf("Tasks: \n");
    prev_task = NULL;
    while (1) {
        prev_task = os_task_info_get_next(prev_task, &oti);
        if (prev_task == NULL) {
            break;
        }

        console_printf("  %s (prio: %u, tid: %u, lcheck: %lu, ncheck: %lu, "
                "flags: 0x%x, ssize: %u, susage: %u, cswcnt: %lu, "
                "tot_run_time: %lums)\n",
                oti.oti_name, oti.oti_prio, oti.oti_taskid, 
                (unsigned long)oti.oti_last_checkin,
                (unsigned long)oti.oti_next_checkin, oti.oti_flags,
                oti.oti_stksize, oti.oti_stkusage, (unsigned long)oti.oti_cswcnt,
                (unsigned long)oti.oti_runtime);

    }
}
