```c
struct os_mbuf *os_mbuf_pullup(struct os_mbuf *om, uint16_t len)
```

Rearrange an mbuf chain so that len bytes are contiguous, and in the data area of an mbuf (so that `OS_MBUF_DATA()` will  work on a structure of size `len`.)  Returns the resulting mbuf chain on success, free's it and returns **NULL** on failure.

<br>

#### Arguments

| Arguments | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `om` | Pointer to mbuf |
| `len` | Length, in bytes, to pullup (make contiguous in mbuf) |

<br>

#### Returned values
Pointer to mbuf at head of chain; **NULL** if not enough mbufs were available to accommodate `len` or if the requested pullup size was too large.

<br>

#### Notes
Hopefully it is apparent to the user that you cannot pullup more bytes than the mbuf can accommodate. Pullup does not allocate more than one mbuf; the entire pullup length must be contained within a single mbuf.

The mbuf that is being pulled up into does not need to be a packet header mbuf; it can be a normal mbuf. The user should note that the maximum pullup length does depend on the type of mbuf being pulled up into (a packet header or normal mbuf).

#### Example

```c
	struct os_mbuf *om;
    struct os_mbuf *tmp;
    struct my_header_struct my_header;

    /* Make sure "my_header" is contiguous in the mbuf */
    tmp = os_mbuf_pullup(om, sizeof(my_header_struct));
    if (!tmp) {
        /* Pullup failed. The chain pointed to by *om has been freed */
        return -1;
    }

    /* copy data from mbuf into header structure */
    memcpy(&my_header, tmp->om_data, sizeof(struct my_header_struct));
```
