```c
struct os_mbuf *os_mbuf_get_pkthdr(struct os_mbuf_pool *omp, uint8_t pkthdr_len);
```

Allocates a packet header mbuf from the mbuf pool pointed to by `omp`. Adds a user header of length `pkthdr_len` to packet header mbuf.

<br>

#### Arguments

| Arguments | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `om` | Pointer to mbuf pool from which to allocate mbuf |
| `pkthdr_len` | The user header packet length to allocate for the packet header mbuf |

<br>

#### Returned values

Returns a pointer to the allocated mbuf or **NULL** if there are no mbufs available or the user packet header was too large.

<br>

#### Notes
The packet header mbuf returned will have its data pointer incremented by the `sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr)` as well as the amount of user header data (i.e. `pkthdr_len`). In other words, the data pointer is offset from the start of the mbuf by: `sizeof(struct os_mbuf)` + `sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr)` + `pkthdr_len`. The `om_pkthdr_len` element in the allocated mbuf is set to: `sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr)` + `pkthdr_len`.

<br>

#### Example

```c
	struct os_mbuf *om;
    struct my_user_header my_hdr;

    /* Get a packet header mbuf with a user header in it */
    om = os_mbuf_get_pkthdr(&g_mbuf_pool, sizeof(struct my_user_header));
    if (om) {
        /* Packet header mbuf was allocated */
    }
```
