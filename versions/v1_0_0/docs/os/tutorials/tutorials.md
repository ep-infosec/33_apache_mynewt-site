## Tutorials

If the introduction to Mynewt has piqued your interest and you want to familiarize yourself with some of its functionality, this series of tutorials is for you. The lessons are aimed at the beginner.

The full list of tutorials can be seen in the navigation bar on the left. New ones are being constantly added and will show up there automatically.

###Prerequisites:

* You have installed Docker container of Newt tool and toolchains or you have installed them natively on your machine
* You have created a new project space (directory structure) and populated it with the core code repository (apache-mynewt-core) or know how to as explained in [Creating Your First Project](../get_started/project_create).
* You have at least one of the supported development boards:
    * [Arduino Zero hardware](arduino_zero.md)
    * [Olimex/STM32F407ZGT6 Cortex-M4 hardware](olimex.md)
    * [nRF52 Development Kit from Nordic Semiconductor](nRF52.md)

The Nordic nrf52 developer kit supports Bluetooth Low Energy. We are always looking to add new hardware to the list, so if you want to develop the required Board Support Package (bsp) and/or Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for a new board, you can look [here](../core_os/porting/port_os/) to get started.
