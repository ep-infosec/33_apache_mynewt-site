# Native Installation 

This section shows you how to install the tools to develop and build Mynewt OS applications on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows, and run and debug the applications on target boards.   For Mac OS and Linux, you can also build Mynewt OS applications that run on Mynewt's simulated hardware. These applications run natively on Mac OS and Linux. 

The tools you need are:

* Newt tool: Tool to create, build, load, and debug Mynewt OS applications.

    * See [Installing the Newt Tool on Mac OS](/newt/install/newt_mac.md) to install on Mac OS.
    * See [Installing the Newt Tool on Linux](/newt/install/newt_linux.md) to install on Linux.
    * See [Installing the Newt Tool on Windows](/newt/install/newt_windows.md) to install on Windows. 
	


* Native toolchain:  Native toolchain to compile and build Mynewt OS applications that run on Mynewt's simulated hardware on Mac OS and Linux.   
	
	(See [Installing Native Toolchain](/os/get_started/native_tools.md)).  

* Cross tools for ARM:  
    * Cross toolchain for ARM to compile and build Mynewt OS applications for target boards.
    * Debuggers to load and debug applications on target boards. 
	
	(See [Installing Cross Tools for ARMs](/os/get_started/cross_tools.md)).


If you would like to use an IDE to develop and debug Mynewt applications, see [using an IDE to develop Mynewt Applications](/faq/ide.md).  You must still perform the native installation outlined on this page.
