### Get set

Apache Mynewt currently offers two ways to quickly get set up, each appealing to different personal preferences and levels of familiarity with embedded systems.

<br>

* **Option 1:** All-in-one docker container that bundles Newt tool, developer toolchains and libraries. For this option, go to [Docker instructions](/DOCSLINK/os/get_started/docker/)

* **Option 2:** Step-by-step instructions to install the Newt tool, developer toolchains and libraries natively on your computer. For this option, go to [Native Setup](/DOCSLINK/os/get_started/native_tools/)

<br>

### Go!

Start a new project as explained under [Create Your First Project](/DOCSLINK/os/get_started/project_create/). The core Mynewt OS is automatically downloaded as part of the project installation.

<br>

* When you [Create Your First Project](/DOCSLINK/os/get_started/project_create/) you define a simulated target and run Project Blinky, the Hello World equivalent in the embedded world.

* If you have one of the supported [boards](/), you can make real LEDs blink in [Project Blinky](/DOCSLINK/os/tutorials/arduino_zero/). Simply choose the appropriate tutorial for the board and proceed.
