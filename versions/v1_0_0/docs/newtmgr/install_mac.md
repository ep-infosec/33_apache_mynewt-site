## Installing Newtmgr on Mac OS

Newtmgr is supported on Mac OS X 64 bit platforms and has been tested on Mac OS 10.9 and higher.

This page shows you how to install the following versions of newtmgr:

* The latest stable release version (1.0.0)
* The latest from the master branch (unstable)

**Note:** If you would like to contribute to the newtmgr tool, see [Setting Up Go Environment to Contribute to Newt and Newtmgr Tools](/faq/go_env).
### Adding the runtimeco/homebrew-mynewt Tap:
You should have added the runtimeco/homebrew-mynewt tap when you installed the *newt* tool. Run the following commands if you have not done so:

```no-highlight
$brew tap runtimeco/homebrew-mynewt
$brew update
```

### Installing the Latest Release Version of Newtmgr
Install the latest stable release version (1.0.0) of newtmgr:
```no-highlight
brew install mynewt-newtmgr
==> Installing mynewt-newtmgr from runtimeco/mynewt
==> Downloading https://github.com/runtimeco/binary-releases/raw/master/mynewt-newt-tools_1.0.0/mynewt-newtmgr-1.0.0.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz
==> Downloading from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/binary-releases/master/mynewt-newt-tools_1.0.0/mynewt-newtmgr-1.0.0.maveric

==> Pouring mynewt-newtmgr-1.0.0.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/mynewt-newtmgr/1.0.0: 3 files, 15.2MB
```
<br>
**Note:** This installs the newtmgr 1.0.0 binary that has been tested on Mac OS 10.9 and higher. If you are running an earlier version of Mac OS, the installation will install the latest version of Go and compile newtmgr locally.

<br>
Check that you are using the installed version of newtmgr:
```no-highlight
$which newtmgr
/usr/local/bin/newtmgr
ls -l /usr/local/bin/newtmgr
lrwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff  42 Apr 15 09:14 /usr/local/bin/newtmgr -> ../Cellar/mynewt-newtmgr/1.0.0/bin/newtmgr
```
**Note:** If you previously built newtmgr from source and the output of `which newtmgr` shows "$GOPATH/bin/newtmgr", you will need to move "$GOPATH/bin"  after "/usr/local/bin" in your $PATH.
