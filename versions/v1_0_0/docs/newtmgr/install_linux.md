## Installing Newtmgr on Linux

You can install the latest stable release (1.0.0) of the newtmgr tool from a Debian binary package (amd64) or from a Debian source package.  This page shows you how to:

1. Set up your computer to retrieve Debian packages from the runtimeco debian package repository. 

    **Note:** You can skip this step if you already set up your computer to access the runtimeco debian repository when you installed the newt tool. 

2. Install the latest stable release version of newtmgr from a Debian binary package. 
3. Install the latest stable release version of newtmgr from a Debian source package.

If you are installing on an amd64 platform, we recommend that you install from the binary package.

**Note:**  We have tested the newtmgr tool binary and apt-get install from the runtimeco Debian package repository for Ubuntu version 16.  Earlier Ubuntu versions (for example: Ubuntu 14) may have incompatibility with the repository. We recommend that you upgrade Ubuntu on your computer.


**Note:** See [Setting Up an Go Environment to Contribute to Newt and Newtmgr Tools](/faq/go_env) if you want to:  

* Use the newtmgr tool with the latest updates from the master branch. The master branch may be unstable and we recommend that you use the latest stable release version.
* Contribute to the newtmgr tool.

### Setting Up Your Computer to Get Packages from runtimeco 

The newtmgr Debian packages are stored in a private repository on **https://github/runtimeco/debian-mynewt**.   You must set up the following on your computer to retreive packages from the repository:

**Note**: You only need to perform this setup once on your computer and you may have already done so when you installed the newt tool. 


1. Install the `apt-transport-https` package to use HTTPS to retrieve packages. 
2. Download the public key for the runtimeco debian repository and import the key into the apt keychain.
3. Add the repository for the binary and source packages to the apt source list.

<br>
Install the apt-transport-https package:
```no-highlight
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```
<br>


Download the public key for the runtimeco apt repo  (**Note:** There is  a `-` after  `apt-key add`):

```no-highlight
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master/mynewt.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```
<br>

Add the repository for the binary and source packages to the `mynewt.list` apt source list file.

```no-highlight
$sudo -s
[sudo] password for <user>:
root$ cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mynewt.list <<EOF
deb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master latest main
deb-src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master latest main
EOF
root$exit
```
**Note:** Do not forget to exit the root shell.

<br>
Verify the content of the source list file:

```no-highlight
$more /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mynewt.list
deb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master latest main
deb-src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master latest main
```
<br>
Update the available packages:
```no-highlight
$sudo apt-get update
```
<br>
**Note:** If you are not using Ubuntu version 16, you may see the following errors.  We recommend that you upgrade Ubuntu.  We have provided instructions on how to manually download and install the binary package if you choose not to upgrade, but you will want to upgrade Ubuntu if you are installing from source.

**Note:** If you are not using Ubuntu version 16 and are not able to update the runtimeco Debian package repo on your computer successfully, you can manually download and install the newtmgr_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb binary package as follows:

```no-highlight
$wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtimeco/debian-mynewt/master/pool/main/n/newtmgr/newtmgr_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb
$sudo dpkg -i newtmgr_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb
```

<br>
See [Checking the Installed Version of Newtmgr](#check) to verify that you are using the installed version of newtmgr.

<br>
### Installing the Latest Stable Release of Newtmgr from a Source Package 

If you are running Linux on a different architecture, you can install the Debian source package for the latest stable release (1.0.0) of newtmgr. The installation of the source package builds the newtmgr binary and creates a Debian binary package that you then install.

**Note**: Newtmgr version 1.0.0 has been tested on Linux amd64 platforms. 

<br>
#### Installing Go 1.7 

You need Go version 1.7 or higher to build Newtmgr version 1.0.0.  Currently, the latest Go version that Ubuntu installs is 1.6.  Run `go version` to check if you have Go 1.7 installed. 

<br>

Install Go version 1.7:

```no-highlight
$sudo apt-get install golang-1.7-go
Reading package lists... Done
     ...
Unpacking golang-1.7-go (1.7.1-2ubuntu1) ...
Setting up golang-1.7-go (1.7.1-2ubuntu1) ...
$
$sudo ln -sf ../lib/go-1.7/bin/go /usr/bin/go
$go version
go version go1.7.1 linux/amd64
```
You can also download version 1.7 from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/). 

<br>
#### Installing from the Source Package
Create a directory and change into the directory, download the source package, and build a binary package from the source package:

```no-highlight
mkdir newtmgr_source
$cd newtmgr_source
$sudo apt-get --build source newtmgr
[sudo] password for <user>: 

sudo apt-get --build source newtmgr

<br>
Install the newtmgr binary package that is created from the source package:

**Note:** The file name for the binary package has the format: newtmgr_1.0.0-1_**arch**.deb,  where **arch** is a value that identifies your host architecture.

###<a name="check"></a> Checking the Installed Version of Newtmgr
After you have installed newtmgr from either a Debian binary or source package, check that you are using the installed version of newtmgr from **/usr/bin**. 

Check the modification time of the binary and the newtmgr tool that you are using:

```no-highlight
$ls -l /usr/bin/newtmgr
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 11473328 Apr 25 10:10 /usr/bin/newtmgr
$which newtmgr
/usr/bin/newtmgr
```

**Note:** If you previously built newtmgr from source and the output of `which newtmgr` shows "$GOPATH/bin/newtmgr", you will need to move "$GOPATH/bin" after "/usr/bin" for your PATH environment variable and export it.
