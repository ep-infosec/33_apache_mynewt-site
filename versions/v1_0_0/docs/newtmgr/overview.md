## Newt Manager

Newt Manager (newtmgr) is the application tool that enables a user to communicate with and manage remote devices running the Mynewt OS. It uses a connection profile to establish a connection with a device and sends command requests to the device.  The tool follows the same command structure as the [newt tool](../newt/newt_ops.md). 


### Available high-level commands
The following are the high-level newtmgr commands. Some of these commands have subcommands. You can use the -h flag to get help for each command. See the documentation for each command in this guide if you need more information and examples.
